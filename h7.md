- `Spectrum analyzer` catches the radio wave -> with the help of the analyzer, one can choose the correct frequency to use.
  - Apparently you have to choose the frequency with a small offset.
- This new frequency in mind, one can take a radio signal sample. (a few seconds is enough)
- From the sample, one is able to see the transmitted bits.
- Things to look out for:
  - Modulation and bit length.     

**x.2 - Decode 433.92 MHz weather station data**

- Recording broadcast on the 433 frequency
  - Launch URH, go to Spectrum Analyzer.
  - Choose SDR (Software Defined Radio), set receiving frequency and gain, then wait for signal
  - No signal? Increase gain.
- Then, create a new project & set frequency according to Spectrum Analyzer with a slight offset (20-100KHz).
- => Record a small sample (at least two bursts).
- Save the recordings you like.
- Create a new signal from a single transmission.
- Identify the modulation from the signal clip.
- Then, you can start decoding.

I found a SDR on <https://eshail.batc.org.uk/nb/>

- I really just zoomed out the waterfall, went to a frequency that seemed to have some action, and just tweaked the settings until it clicked.
- I played around with the filter and modulators until I started hearing a voice. It sounded like russian, so I have no idea what was said.
- This was the one:

- **Frequency:** 10489689.7kHz / 10,49MHZ
- **Wavelength:** ~28,6m (*Velocity* divided by *frequency*)
- **Modulator:** USB (Upper Sideband)     


# B) rtl_433
I installed the package rtl_433 on my kali-linux VM by using the command:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install rtl-433
```
Package can be run:

# C) Analysis
> We are downloading and analysing a sample: <https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/samples/Converted_433.92M_2000k.cs8>     

By using the `-r` flag for rtl_433, we're able to read from file:
- <img width="1025" height="668" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-04 17-40-40" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8783ed59-4f91-4467-abcf-6f5531bfc275" />
- <img width="1025" height="642" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-04 17-51-21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8971fb9-e7fa-4e13-bd0b-0b3c85b19c95" />     


### What's going on?
- We can find a recurring ID in the sample => `8785315`
  - In a two places it's named `House Code`
  - And in those places we either find `Model = Nexa-Security` or `Model = Proove-Security`
  - I guess we can deduce from the sample, that we are working with some sort of home appliances, that belong to the same area/site/room/house/unit etc..

The sample starts with an entry from `KlikAanKlikUit-Switch` and includes the section => `Command : Off`.      
This insinuates that a command is being given, which in this case is "off".     
Immediately afterwards we get two outputs:
- `Proove-Security` && `Nexa-Security` are each returning with a `State : OFF` section, both having their `House Code` match the ID with the Switch.
- I think the Switch is sending an off signal, and the appliances are returning that their state is in fact off. So in total 3 entries for this one operation.
- This happens 4 times over in the sample (4 click operations if you will 😆).

- By doing a search online, we can find a few possibilites for what we could be working with. Here are just 2 examples:
- <https://prooveglobal.com/>
  - <img width="1333" height="763" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-04 18-47-19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2635a055-cc83-4932-8842-b6776a8f2063" />
- <https://www.nexasecurity.nl/>

# D) Too complex?
> Sample: <https://terokarvinen.com/verkkoon-tunkeutuminen-ja-tiedustelu/samples/Recorded-HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz.complex16s>     

We have a sample taken with `URH` (Universal Radio Hacker) in the format `complex16s`, and we want to be able to read it using `rtl_433`.      
I actually searched online for conversion tools etc. until I stumbled upon a very helpful tip from our teacher Tero Karvinen.      
For the conversion, you simple change the name of the file to include the `cs8` suffix, which `rtl_433` then can read.     
**Note:** The filename also needs to include *center frequency* and *sample rate*, using a simple underscore as the delimeter.     
So I changed the file name from `Recorded-HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz.complex16s` to `urhConverted_433.92M_2000k.cs8`.      
`_433.92M_2000k.cs8` being the crucial part.     
The command then becomes very simple:
```bash
$ mv Recorded-HackRF-20250411_183354-433_92MHz-2MSps-2MHz.complex16s urhSampleConverted_433.92M_2000k.cs8
```
Now we're able to read the sample using `rtl_433`:
- <img width="1062" height="579" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-04 22-25-47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf34a89f-0e84-4702-bb11-6aa0f572ab5c" />
- We can very quickly notice, that it is the same sample provided to us earlier.
- The switch sending the off command, and the appliances replying.
- For an analysis, look at the previous section!     

More on the formats here:

# E) Ultimate Radio Hacker
> Install urh, Universal Radio Hacker.     

I tried to install it with the command provided in the tips section:
```bash
$ pipx install urh
```
But it kept failing. Error logs said that I need to install `cython`, which I did, and still didn't work.
- <img width="541" height="337" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-05 11-22-52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1410c970-e061-4298-a9fa-6be0c92868c4" />

I thought it had something do with me using `pipx`, which apparently does the whole virtual environment isolation automatically for you, so I thought I'd try creating it myself (the virtual environment), following the same kind of workflow Tero showed us in class.      
Create folder for the env, and move into it:
```bash
$ mkdir urh && cd urh
```

Create virtual environment:
```
$ virtualenv env
```
<img width="1108" height="273" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-05 10-56-12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/026f969e-60c9-4f61-bd81-4cf0942fd92a" />

Use it with the command:
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```
<img width="480" height="168" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-05 11-04-29" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b62d448-eb72-40fa-951b-7d4f4d0db0b5" />


An `env` prompt will appear to indicate that you are using that virtual environment. If you wish to stop using it, simply give the command
```
$ deactivate
```

I then installed cython using:
```
pip install cython
```

And then urh using:
```
pip install urh
```

BUT:
- <img width="1047" height="663" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-05 11-31-50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c85ac53e-67ac-4777-a6f4-f4f9c27f0089" />
- We need cython, but cython is already installed?

Option 2:
