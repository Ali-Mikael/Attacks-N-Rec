# Cyber Security Nordic 2025

## Networking & discovery
I attended the CybSec Nordic 25 event. This is a quick summary of the 2 most interesting interactions I had.

### Spear Innovations
The company specializes in authentication solutions for enterprises, but is also consumer facing.      
The things that caught my attention was the Fido02 Security Key and authentication smart card.     
I liked the security key in comparison to Yubikey because of 3 things:
- It's more durable
- It's cheaper
- It's a Finnish company producing it

The smart card was interesting because:
- You can (to my understanding) integrate their solution into a management system you already use and "love".
  - Easy to setup & use.
- Apparently the card cannot be copied from distance and is designed to withstand physical tampering.    


### SSH
This was by far the most fascinating interaction for me. Largely due to the fact that I got to talk to one of their key technical specialists.         
We discussed the future of passwords, attack vectors, the vulnerability known as "being human" and how to take it into consideration when building for security.      
Security should always be built into the foundations for anything we're trying to create, not a quick afterthought.     
<br> 
We had compelling dialogue on the post quantum computing world, what it means for cyber security, but also the internet as a whole. How to make ICT = quantum safe. 
This was especially intriguing, as we had scraped the surface of such a topic the day before, at an event hosted by IBM at their Helsinki office.       

#### Thoughts
5/5 would like to go again!
