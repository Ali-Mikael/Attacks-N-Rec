- `Spectrum analyzer` catches the radio wave -> with the help of the analyzer, one can choose the correct frequency to use.
  - Apparently you have to choose the frequency with a small offset.
- This new frequency in mind, one can take a radio signal sample. (a few seconds is enough)
- From the sample, one is able to see the transmitted bits.
- Things to look out for:
  - Modulation and bit length.     

**x.2 - Decode 433.92 MHz weather station data**

- Recording broadcast on the 433 frequency
  - Launch URH, go to Spectrum Analyzer.
  - Choose SDR (Software Defined Radio), set receiving frequency and gain, then wait for signal
  - No signal? Increase gain.
- Then, create a new project & set frequency according to Spectrum Analyzer with a slight offset (20-100KHz).
- => Record a small sample (at least two bursts).
- Save the recordings you like.
- Create a new signal from a single transmission.
- Identify the modulation from the signal clip.
- Then, you can start decoding.

I found a SDR on <https://eshail.batc.org.uk/nb/>

- I really just zoomed out the waterfall, went to a frequency that seemed to have some action, and just tweaked the settings until it clicked.
- I played around with the filter and modulators until I started hearing a voice. It sounded like russian, so I have no idea what was said.
- This was the one:

- **Frequency:** 10489689.7kHz / 10,49MHZ
- **Wavelength:** ~28,6m (*Velocity* divided by *frequency*)
- **Modulator:** USB (Upper Sideband)
