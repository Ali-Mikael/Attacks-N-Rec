# H/0 getting started

### Fishing for packets
Fired up wireshark, and started capturing.

Upon inspecting a certain (very randomly chosen) packet, we can find relevant info regarding it, for example: IP version, source/destination address, source/destination ports, header type etc.   
We can safely deduce this was a return HTTPS packet from a web server.   
The destination address is our own, source port 443 was used (indicating HTTP in conjuntion with TLS, = HTTPS) and 
this was in fact part of the negotation process between client and server to establish a secure connection (the TLS handshake) as we find out upon further investigation.  
The server in question is acknowledging our previous packet (the initial client hello) and sending parameters (server hello) for building the secure session.
