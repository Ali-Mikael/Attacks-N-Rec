# H6 WiFi

## A) Getting to know the environment
We are exploring the `Wifi_Challenge_Lab-v2.3`: <https://lab.wifichallenge.com>        

### Download the shabang
- It can be found, inspected and downloaded from: <https://lab.wifichallenge.com/README>
- Git repo: <https://github.com/r4ulcl/WiFiChallengeLab-docker>       

### My facilities
**Lenovo ThinkPad L490**
- **CPU:** *IntelCore i3-8145U*
- **GPU:** *Intel UHD grapchis 620 (WHL GT2)*
- **Memory:** *8GB*
- **Disk:** *256GB*
- **OS:** *Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS*
- **Kernel:** *Linux 6.8.0-87-generic*       
Running the VM (lab environment) using: `VirtualBox 7.0` 


### Start
- Downloaded the VB-version of the lab from the website.
- Unzipped the contents.
- Sanity check: `shasum -a 256 *.ova`, hashes match --> can continue
- Import to VBox

- Start machine
- Voila

## B) Report on your findings     
**Recommended tools:**
- `wifi_db`
  - <https://github.com/r4ulcl/wifi_db>
  - **README:** "*Script to parse Aircrack-ng captures into a SQLite database and extract useful information like handshakes (in 22000 hashcat format), MGT identities, interesting relations between APs, clients and it's Probes, WPS information and a global view of all the APs seen.*"
- `aircrack-ng`
  - <https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng?tab=readme-ov-file>
  - **README:** "*Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.*"
    - Monitoring, Attacking, Testing & Cracking
- `airgeddon`
  - <https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon>
  - Out of a long list of features, a few..:
    - WPS scanning, Decloak of hidden ESSID networks, Cleaning and optimizing Handshake captured files.
    - WPA3 online dictionary attack, Evil Twin attacks, Simple integrated sniffing (Hostapd + DHCP + DoS + Ettercap), DoS over wireless networks
- `eaphammer`
  - <https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer>
  - **README:** "*EAPHammer is a toolkit for performing targeted evil twin attacks against WPA2-Enterprise networks.*"
- `hashcat`
  - <https://hashcat.net/hashcat/>
  - **README:** *"hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility."*

I fired up the VM and started exploring with some help from the user friendly *walkthrough* provided: <https://r4ulcl.com/posts/walkthrough-wifichallenge-lab-2.0/>       

Everything started with the `airmon-ng` command. 
**Q:** But what is it?      
**A:** Straight from the man pages: **"*airmon-ng* This script can be used to enable monitor mode on wireless interfaces."**     
I ran some commands and played detective.      
<br> 
I first tried `wlan1`, but it didn't find anything, so I ran:
```
$ ip link show
```

Then
```
sudo airmon-ng start wlan3
```

**Choosing the first intarface I saw**
```
$ sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --manufacturer --wps --band abg
```

I wanted to know more about the `wifi-corp`, so I took up the channel (44) and ran the command with the channel parameter
```
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w ~/wifi/channel44 --manufacturer --wps -c44
```
- The `-w ~/wifi/channel44` saves capture in the `wifi directory` under name `channel44`.

- I could at least figure at the BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) `F0:9F:C2:71:22:15` and the (presumably) MAC address `64:32:A8:07:6C:40` of their AP.

There's so much more to discover, but it took me 3 hours to get everything set up (don't ask 😂), and unfortunately I don't have any more time, so I will continue at a later time!    

### C) Thoughts
What did I learn?
- I learned how to, but most importantly, how easy it is to discover networks around you, for the purpose of further recon and ultimately infiltration.
- I familiarized myself with some new wifi hacking concepts and tools.
- I also learned basic usage of a few tools used for aforementioned tasks.      

This also opened my eyes on how careful you have to be in public WiFi, and will probably never again connect to one without a VPN.
- The more you know.... ("Tieto lisää tuskaa")
